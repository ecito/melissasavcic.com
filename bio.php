		<p class="biop">Hello Hello! I'm Melissa Savčić and I sing and write songs with my guitar. I grew up in a little town in Venezuela, where we only had one movie theater. Nowadays that movie theater is gone and my poor town doesn't even have one! ha! "Looking Back" is about my town Judibana where I sang in the school chorus as soprano, put together my first rock band and started to write songs at age 15.</p>
		<p class="biop">After relocating to Houston I teamed up with lead guitarist, Chris Garver in November 2008. I guess we hit it off because we've been playing together ever since and have written 11 songs. We think that "acoustic/alternative/pop" describes our music nicely.</p>
		<p class="biop"> After several months we added a bass player, Craig Nelson to our lineup and he has added some nice melodic dimension to our music.</p>
		<p class="biop"> On October 2009, we finally found our drummer, Josh Schusterman who has taken our music to a bigger funkier electric sound playing shows around the Houston area.</p>
		<p class="biop"> We released our debut demo on April 2009. Currently only available at our shows, and we are also in the process of recording new songs and adding drums to the old ones... Wait for it! </p>
