<p><h2>Sweet Song</h2></p>

<p><strong>Verse I</strong></p>

<p>You're my angel, you're so sweet<br />
you're the one I most adore<br />
You're so kind, your pretty smile<br />
that sparkle in your eyes<br />
Everything's so magical<br />
can't wait to spend my life with you<br />
Your appealing face, so much success<br />
there's no one better than you<br />
Love the way you laugh<br />
you're the light of my life<br />
You've no idea how beautiful you are</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>

<p>I'd follow you anywhere<br />
can't live without you<br />
I've become addicted to you<br />
You truly changed my life<br />
since the night we watched the clouds<br />
I wanted so much to kiss you then<br />
I only want you for myself<br />
feel your arms around me<br />
Can't wait until the morning comes<br />
so I can see you again</p>

<p><strong>Verse II</strong></p>

<p>You protect me calm me down<br />
those dark brown eyes can't get enough<br />
Of your perfect soul<br />
you're just so beautiful<br />
When you whisper in my ear<br />
when you hold me so tight<br />
There's nothing better in this life<br />
than being next to you</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>

<p>I believe in your love<br />
You stood by me every moment<br />
With your trusting hands and caring words<br />
I love how you hold me<br />
You know me well<br />
You're my inspiration<br />
Come drive away to big city lights<br />
Just how we used to like get lost in time<br />
Just you and me</p>
