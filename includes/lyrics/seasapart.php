<p><h2>Seas Apart</h2></p>

<p><strong>Verse I</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it's true we have drifted apart<br />
Even though I've left, I still remember you<br />
get so happy when talk and to know<br />
that you haven't changed<br />
You know I'd had to leave to find a better life</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>

<p>I miss you, wish you could be here<br />
I promise I will see you then<br />
You've always meant so much to me</p>

<p><strong>Verse II</strong></p>

<p>I know it was sad at the airport<br />
You hugged me so tight, said our goodbyes that day<br />
I know you can never come; you have no visa<br/>
that's just how it is<br />
Sorry I missed your first born<br/>
from the pictures she looked beautiful</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bridge</strong></p>

<p>Friends since 1999, longest friendship I've had<br />
I haven't seen you in years<br/>
but I still keep that picture<br />
you know the one we are jumping from the tree<br />
always brings that smile to my face<br />
I cannot leave those memories</p>


<p>I keep holding on to the past<br />
again I wish you could be here cause I know<br />
I can always count on you; you can always count on me<br />
I miss you, wish you could be here<br />
I promise I will see you then<br />
You've always meant so much to me</p>
