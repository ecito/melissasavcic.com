<p><h2>Hold On</h2></p>

<p>Hold on, try to breath<br />
there are many worse things in life<br />
Can't stop the pain<br />
try to accept how everything is now<br />
Others need you<br />
don't think about the bad stuff<br />
There are many worse things in life</p>

<p>I don't want to feel this way anymore<br />
I don't want to feel this way<br />
I want to be ok</p>

<p>Don't pray, don't pray,<br />
cause there's no one listening to you anyway<br />
I know, I've waited for some miracle<br />
but it's not happening<br />
Free your mind<br />
allow to open up your heart<br />
Keep trying to make things better</p>

<p>feel tire from it all<br /> 
can you help me find the way.<br /> 
Cannot reach bliss, hopeless<br />
Stop saying hold on</p>

<p>Have a better life than this someday<br />
Memories is all I got left of my dreams<br />
There are many worse things in life<br />
I don't want to feel this way anymore<br />
I don't want to feel this way<br />
I want to be ok someday, someday<br />
Just remember the good times you've had</p>

<p>I know<br />
I should be grateful for what I got<br />
Free my hold on</p>
