<p><h2>Looking Back</h2></p>

<p><strong>Verse I</strong></p>
<p>It seems so long ago when I was 15 years old<br />
Sitting outside on the grass beneath that orange sky<br />
No worries, no future in mind, just watching the cars pass by<br />
Just me and that strong wind that never fails<br />
to calm that warm weather</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>It was paradise, paradise to me<br />
the link to who I am<br />
It was paradise, peaceful times<br />
time just passed by so slowly<br />
Slide down the dunes, tan on the beach<br />
climb the 830 meters high mountain</p>

<p><strong>Verse II</strong></p>
<p>I had this perfect view of the sunset just 5 mins away<br />
Standing on the cliff I watched the sun vanish down the bay <br />
After dark, just walk back home without any concern<br />
From my house's roof I lay and watch the stars all night</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>


<p><strong>Bridge</strong></p>
<p>It seems so long ago that I was this careless<br />
foolish from the start<br />
Living the laid back life<br />
Free as a bird, fearless to the unknown<br />
Wear my brother's clothes<br />
steal my parents' car every night<br />
Never studied in high school<br />
love to skip class, stayed by the pool<br />
I only hang with the older kids,<br />
had the energy to stay up till 7 in the morning</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>Relax relax relax…</p>
