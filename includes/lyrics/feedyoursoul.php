<p><h2>Feed your soul</h2></p>

<p><strong>Verse I</strong></p>

<p>Define yourself, develop a life profound<br />

Live through your heart, only you control your life<br />

Be inspired, feel the music in your bones<br />

Enjoy it all, feed your soul<br />

Save yourself, from all the shitty things in life<br />

Sacrifice whatever to engage, the greatness that's in you</p>

<p><strong>chorus</strong></p>

<p>Someday you'll wake up<br />
and your life has vanished<br />
You gotta take some action<br />
to make things happen, I say</p>

<p><strong>Verse II</strong></p>

<p>Have to regrets, do what you love<br />

Beyond any reasonable doubt, change you lifestyle if you like<br />

Get all crazy, allow yourself to make mistakes<br />

No matter what anybody says, it's your life</p>

<p><strong>chorus</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bridge</strong></p>
<p>God knows how hard you've tried<br />
you got to keep on going, I say</p>

<p><strong>Verse III</strong></p>
<p>Art is so beautiful, I can't believe my eyes<br />

It's so amazing, I feel the colors in my soul<br />

Feel free to do what makes you happy<br />

Feel the freedom you posses, dreams can come true<br />

Free you soul, laugh for no apparent reason<br />

Appreciate what you got</p>

<p><strong>chorus</strong></p>
