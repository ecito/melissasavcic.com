<p><h2>What if</h2></p>


<p><strong>Verse I</strong></p>

<p>Why can't we all just get along?<br />
Don't set my dreams on fire<br />
Sharing, respecting minds, stop being so selfish<br />
If there were no more war in the world<br />
The world would be a better place</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>There wouldn't be so many problems<br />
we could live in harmony<br />
Nothing is perfect<br />
I just wonder how the world could be<br />
Untie your fears, unleash your tears<br />
embrace what's real<br />
Why can't we get along?</p>

<p><strong>Verse II</strong></p>

<p>See through the others point of view and find<br />
how understanding we can be<br />
Trapped in your own bubble<br />
not sharing with others<br />
Hiding hiding from the truth<br />
No matter the color of your skin<br />
respect all religions<br />
We are different, that's what makes us special</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>


<p><strong>Bridge</strong></p>

<p>This is just the time for peace and love for a change</p>

<p><strong>Verse III</strong></p>

<p>Compassion might reveal your real side<br />
If there were real impartial justice - that might help<br />
The world would be a better place</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
