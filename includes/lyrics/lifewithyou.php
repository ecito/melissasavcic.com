<p><h2>Life with you</h2></p>


<p><strong>Verse I</strong></p>

<p>My song is about real love and it's only for you<br />
Wake up next to every morning it's hard to get to work<br />
Many road trips, many skylines<br/>
many pools many memories<br />
Celebrating each month, weekday movies kissing so hard<br/>
You know I love it all</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>

<p>I feel there's nothing more certain than us<br />
I can't wait to marry you<br />
you know I'll never let you go<br />
Our life together makes the best story you know</p>

<p><strong>Verse II</strong></p>

<p>Cook together listening to our favorite songs<br />
You believe in me, let me be myself<br />
Your support, your comfort, your understanding<br />
Is all I need</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>


<p><strong>Bridge</strong></p>
<p>I could run away with you<br />
pursue my dream to play and sing<br />
and all my songs be for you<br />
You know that is true</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
